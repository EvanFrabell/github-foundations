# GitHub Online Interface

## Branches

### Create Branch
Click branch button -> New branch -> Branch Name -> Branch source -> Create branch

### List branches
Switch back to main -> click # branches

## Repo Access Controls

### Why restrict access?
- One of GitHub's key benefits is that anyone with an internet connection can access the platform.
- Datasets with personal information
- Developing or using commercial products

### Private Repositories
- Created when first setting up a repo 
- Will always appear next to your repo's name

### Adding Collaborators
- Settings -> Collaborators -> Add people

### Branch Protection Rules
- Rules for specific branches
- Require a pull request before merging
- Require that pull requests are approved before merging
- Restrict who can delete a protected branch
- Settings -> Branches -> Add rule

## Personal Access Tokens (PAT)

### Authentication
- Use git in the terminal to interact with GitHub
- Use the GitHub API
- git clone https://github.com/username/repository
- Alternative to using passwords for passwords
- Required since Aug 2021

### Create a PAT
- Profile icon -> Account settings -> Developer settings -> Personal access tokens -> Generate new token
- Note, expiration, scope

### Using the PAT
- Paste in PAT for password when authenticating outside GitHub.com


## Cloning and Forking

### Cloning a repo
- Similar to copy-paste
- Linked to the original repo
- Creates a copy on a local computer
- Allows updates to go back and forth (push/pull)

### Clone a repo
- Github.com -> Code -> copy url of repository
- git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git

### Forking a repo
- A copy of a repo without linking back to it.
- Forks create independent copies of a repo without anything reaching the original repo.
- Useful for experimenting without risk.
- After forking, a pull request can be made from an outside contributor that would like to join the product.

### Fork a repo
- Fork button -> + Create a new fork -> *Amend Repository name -> Select branch you'd like to fork from


## GitHub Issues
- GitHub issues are messages to track problem fixes, plans, important tasks, and communications for a project.

### Create a new issue
- GitHub.com -> Issues tab -> New issue -> Submit new issue

### Assign an issue
- Assignees -> Type in user

### Assign vs. Tag
- Assign = who should work on the issue
- Tag = who needs to read the issue

### Link to another issue
- In the comments type #

### Quote a previous comment
- Click ellipses on previous comment -> Quote reply

### Close an issue
- Close with comment

## Pull Requests
- A way to notify others about changes
- Allows the repo owner to check changes before they are added
- Best practicce to add changes to a branch that is not the main branch
- A successful PR is merging two branches

### Create a PR
- Navigate to Pull requests tab -> New pull request
- Base branch = Branch we want to add our updates to
- Compare branch = Branch that contains our updates
