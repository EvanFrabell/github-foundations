## Secure Development
- Essential for all projects
- Reduces manual work
- Find vulnerabilities early

### GitHub Advanced Security
- Code Scanning - Identifies vulnerabilities in the code
- Secret Scanning - Detects vulnerable sensitive data
- Dependency Graph & Dependabot - Manage dependencies and automate security updates

### Dependency Graph
- Visualize all project dependencies
- Spot Risks identifies vulnerabities in the project
- Tracks updates to dependencies
- Insights -> Dependency graph

### Dependabot
- Linked to Dependency Graph and crawls through your repos to find dependency vulnerabilities
- Alerts: Notifies you of vulnerabilities
- Updates automatically fix issues with a pull request

## Security Policies & Managing Sensitive Data

### Setting Up Security Policies
- Create SECURITY.md file
- Contains contact info, guidelines, response times
- Seecurity tab -> Policy -> Start Setup

### Committing Sensitive Data
- Risk of leaking sensitive data
- Unauthorized access
- Act quickly to remove data from commit history (change credentials asap)

### Removing Sensitive Data from Git History
- git filter-repo: more complex, slower, and precise
- BFG Repo-Cleaner: Fast and simple to use
