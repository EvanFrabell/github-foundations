# Remote Repositories

A remote repo is a repo stored in the cloud through an online repo hosting service (GitHub).  It takes your local repo online to collaborate with others.

- git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repositoryname.git
- git remote -v
- git add .
- git commit -m "Initial commit"
- git push -u origin main

## Fetching vs Pulling from Remote
- Fetching: Sychronizes the files and branches in a remote to a local repo. The does not merge the remote repo's contents into the local repo.
- Pulling: Fetches and merges with a single command.

### Fetching from a remote
git fetch origin

### Fetching a remote branch
git fetch origin main

### Synchronize content
git merge origin
(Merge origin remote's default branch into the local repo's current branch)

### Pulling from a remote
git pull origin
(Fetch and merge origin remote's default branch into the local repo's current branch)

### Pulling a remote branch
git pull origin dev-branch
