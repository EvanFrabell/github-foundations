- Used for Secured Socket Shell (SSH) connections

### OAuth Authorization Model
- Secure, limited access for apps
- Used for connecting data tools to GitHub


## Team Synchronization
- Automatically links GitHub teams to IdP groups
- Requires GitHub Enterprise Cloud or an IdP (Okta, Azure AD, etc.)

- Scalability

- Azure AD Group settings > GitHub Organization Settings > Authentication security > Enable SAML Authentication > Setup Team > Select Identity Provider Groups

## Onboarding Employees
- Invite employee to Organization

- Request 2FA setup
- IdP automates the rest

## Offboarding Employees
