### GitHub vs. Git
Git is a version control software and can be used independently from GitHub or another hosting platform. GitHub is a platform that enhances Git to make it easier to manage projects and collaborate. It is entirely dependent on Git.

### Collaboration

- Complete history of every project stage

### GitHub Repo

- Will contain all files of a project and record past versions of files

### Create a new repository

### Add .gitignore
- The gitignore file blocks or ignores specific files from being committed or saved into our repo.

### Pull Requests
