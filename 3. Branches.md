# Branches

### What is it
- Branch = an individual version of a repository
- They enable us to have multiple versions of our files and track each version systematically

### Why use it
- Production (Live, works as expected) vs Feature Development (issues, testing)
- Multiple developers can work on a project simultaneously
- Easy to compare the repo's state between branches
- Combine contents, merging new features to a live system
- Each branch has a specific purpose

### Terminology
- Creating a new branch = "branching off"
- Creating "branch-creation-test" from master = "branching off master"

### Identifying branches
git branch

### Switching between branches
git switch master

### Creating a new branch
git branch branch-creation-test

### Create new branch and switch
git switch -c branch-creation-test

### Comparing branches
git diff master branch-creation-test

### Navigate large git outputs
Press space to progress and q to exit

### Renaming a branch
git branch -m 2nd-bc-test useless-branch

### Deleting a branch
If merged: git branch -d another-useless-branch
If not merged: git branch -D another-useless-branch

## Merging

### Merging 2 branches
- Last commits from each branch are called parent commits
- source = branch we want to merge from
- destination = branch we want to merge into

### Merge into current branch
git merge source

### Merge source into destination branch
git merge source destination

### Bug fixing
- You have a bug on the main branch after merging into it customer-fix-branch.  To fix the bug you should delete the customer-fix-branch and branch off main into a new branch to fix the bug.


## Merge Conflicts
### Conflicts
- Inability for git to resolve differenece in the contents of one or more files between branches
- Occurs when editing the same file in 2 branches

### Resolve Conflicts
- nano filename.md
- ctrl + O, enter
- ctrl + X
- git add filename.md
- git commit -m "resolve filename.md conflict"
- git merge source
