# Branches

### What is it
- Branch = an individual version of a repository
- They enable us to have multiple versions of our files and track each version systematically

### Why use it
- Production (Live, works as expected) vs Feature Development (issues, testing)
- Multiple developers can work on a project simultaneously
- Easy to compare the repo's state between branches
- Combine contents, merging new features to a live system
- Each branch has a specific purpose

### Identifying branches
git branch

### Switching between branches
git switch master

### Creating a new branch
git branch branch-creation-test
